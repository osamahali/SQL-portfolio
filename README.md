## SQL-portfolio
Hi There,
Thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of SQL I've written and created for solo projects. Below
are a few highlighted projects, including couple of data visualizations I created using Tableau.I will keep add  more project with time, feel free to take a look around and reach me out if you have any feedback or questions.

## Highlighted Projects - SQL

**Project 1 Analaysis**
This project is In this project, I used a dataset from worldfake data to analyze trends in the top 50 songs of 2021.
Using pitch-class integer notation, I examined the key and tonality for these top songs. I joined data from a Hooktheory
database to compare the most popular song keys with the song keys most represented in the top 50 Spotify tracks of 2021.

**Project 2 Analaysis**
I used my own data from Goodreads to analyze how my book ratings differ from the average ratings found on Goodreads.
I categorized the books by genre and obtained the average difference in rating per genre. I created another table
containing similar data for books that won the Booker Prize for Fiction from 2000-2021 and joined this data to predict,
for each Booker Prize-winning book, what my rating would be.

## Highlighted Projects Dashboard - Tableau


**Project 1 Tableau**

- Data: from this website
- Audience: C-suit
- Purpose: Identify factors behind low profit ratio in order to boost profits

In this dashboard, I used a Tableau dataset containing sample sales data from 2018 to 2021. Though the sample dataset provides a wider
overview of sales data, I saw an opportunity to strategically visualize clear, actionable insights to my fictional audience of sales executives.
The dashboard allows my audience to immediately pinpoint the geographical, categorical, and seasonal factors that are leading to profit loss — providing
the guided insight that allows them to impact change on their team.


**Project 2 Tableau**


- Data: from this website
- Audience: C-suit
- Audience: Anyone interested in geography & culture
- Purpose: Explore and interact with visualized world happiness data

In this dashboard, I used a Tableau dataset containing sample sales data from 2018 to 2021. Though the sample dataset provides a wider
overview of sales data, I saw an opportunity to strategically visualize clear, actionable insights to my fictional audience of sales executives.
The dashboard allows my audience to immediately pinpoint the geographical, categorical, and seasonal factors that are leading to profit loss — providing
the guided insight that allows them to impact change on their team.

The World Happiness Report dataset ranks the happiness of 155 countries from 2015 to 2019. For this dashboard, I wanted the audience to be able to dive deeper
into countries around the world and gain a contextual understanding of where those countries rank against the world average. The dashboard allows the user to explore
the world map and compare metrics across countries. I'm endlessly interested in world geography and cultural nuances, so I created a dashboard that gets right to the
information points I would most want to play with.
